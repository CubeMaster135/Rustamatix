# Rustamatix
An animation library that works with ggez for Rust-lang

To compile and test yourself, simply clone the repository, enter it and run `cargo run` in your terminal. Basic documentation will be created at a later date but you are free to read through the library source code at `Rustamatix/rustamatix/src/lib.rs` or the test file that incorporates the library to draw an animated sprite at `Rustamatix/app/src/main.rs`.
